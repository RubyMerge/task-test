Task description:

Create a Rails application, which will convert a number to a money string (please, choose Russian or Ukrainian language). 
Application has to convert 1 to “одна гривна“, 1234567 to “один миллион двести тридцать четыре тысячи пятьсот шестьдесят семь гривен“, 
etc. Words should have correct endings: “1 гривна“, “2 гривны“, “5 гривен“, “3 миллиона“, “3 тысячи“, etc. (provided examples are for Russian)

Implement main logic on server-side (Ruby). It’s a logical test, so solution shouldn’t be based on a gem or something like that.

Your app should have one page which would consist of one text input (without any submit buttons). Once number is entered/changed its text equivalent should appear below.

Application should work properly with integer numbers from 0 to 999999999.
You may use a front-end framework: Vue, React or Angular.
Please do this on your github account as a public repo. Make frequent commits and use best practices.
